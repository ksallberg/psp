## Dependencies

Currently I only managed to install the psp toolchain on
linux x86-64. I installed all dependencies using 'apt',
set up

```
export PSPDEV=/usr/local/pspdev
export PATH=$PATH:$PSPDEV/bin
```

and then ran './toolchain.sh'.

### Using docker for macOS

I could not compile psptoolchain on my latest&greatest macOS computer,
and had to resort to docker:

#### Create

```
docker run --name hackburk2 -it --mount type=bind,source=/Users/kristiansallberg/Documents/psp,target=/home/psp ubuntu
```

#### Enter again
```
docker exec -it hackburk2 bash
```

Go to /home/psp, source env.sh and make
(provided psptoolchain is already compiled)

# Kuriosa

The PSP's main microprocessor is a multifunction device
named "Allegrex" that includes a 32-bit MIPS32 R4k-based
CPU (Little Endian), a Floating Point Unit,
and a Vector Floating Point Unit.
